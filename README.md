# FreezerFixer
An application that moddells your freezer and helps you to keep it tidy. I figured out it this is a implmentation of a 3D bin packing problem. 

The model-wiev-controller design pattern will be used. 

The goal for the view is to be both a website coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript aswell as an android app. If possible these two models should access the same data. A system for users would be cool. 

The controller is a bit tricky, but will most liklye be a part of the view. 

As for the model will be written is Java. Im not sure what it will need jet. But som fetures should be:

  - Create you freezerspace
  - Create the itmes you put in the freezer
  - Make these items personizable, like putting pictures of what is in them, maybe this is more of a view thing? 
  - Make an algorithm that calculates the most space efficiant way to order you freezer items.
